    <h3>How Does Email Tracking Work?</h3>
    <p>
        When emails are opened, they often automatically display images. As the sender of an email you can link an image
        in such a way so that the receiver must download it from the internet first. This server allows you to generate a
        unique link that you can put inside any email. When the email is received, the image (an invisible 1x1 pixel) is
        downloaded and displayed. This service tracks when links are opened and by whom, so you know when your email has
        been opened.
    </p>

    <h3>How Do I Start?</h3>
    <p>
        Simply press the "Generate" button below and paste the link into any email. In order to appear less suspicious,
        you have the option to change the link however you wish by appending to the URL. For example, here's an
        example link: <span style="text-decoration: dotted underline"><span class="link-placeholder">http://thissite.com</span>/t/4ee275cb-c3ce-4ba4-9dee-b0fbfb21afbf</span>.
        You can make this into: <span style="text-decoration: dotted underline"><span class="link-placeholder">http://thissite.com</span>/t/4ee275cb-c3ce-4ba4-9dee-b0fbfb21afbf/notsuspicious/cats.gif</span>
        if you wish, but be sure not to delete anything from the URL or it will not work. Enjoy!
