# emailTracker
A *very* simple email tracking web application created for uni Python 492.

# Major Obstacles and Learning Opportunities
Most of these were firsts for me in any language, especially Python, which I was just recently introduced to.

- Working with SQLite (from PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- Password storage: secure hashing and salting
- File hosting with Flask (and hosting a site with Flask)
- Deciding how user accounts would work with tracking links
- Dynamically adding links for Flask to listen to (instead of hardcoding paths)
- Working with browser cookies server-side and client-side, and managing user sessions securely (no passwords in cookies, timeouts, log out functionality, etc)
- More work with ajax requests: loading information without requiring a reload and submitting forms without redirects
